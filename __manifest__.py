Parcel Transportation Management
=================================
A professional, lightweight parcel transportation management system for a bus/coach-based
parcel service: simple origin/destination, trips, destination authorization, payments, SMS
notifications and public tracking.

Features:
---------
* Parcel Order with automatic tracking number generation
* Trip management (bus company, agent, origin/destination, assigned parcels)
* Parcel Agents with auto-generated agent codes
* Public, login-free "Agent Receiving" form on the website (parcel number + agent code)
* Destination agent authorization workflow for arrival and delivery
* Lightweight payment tracking with authorization workflow
* SMS notifications sent through the standalone SwalaSMS Integration module (swala_sms) - any
  message sent here goes through SwalaSMS once configured there, with a mock/test provider used
  automatically until then
* SMS history log with retry support
* Public, login-free parcel tracking page on the website
* Exactly 4 role-based security groups: Administrator (full access), Receiving Officer (create,
  receive, assign to Trip, mark ready for dispatch), Dispatcher (manage/dispatch Trips, plus a
  backend fallback to authorize arrival and payment when the field agent hasn't done it on the
  website yet), Finance Manager (oversee/manage payments and the Dashboard)
* Operational dashboard with KPIs and breakdowns
* Full chatter / activity / audit trail on every key document
